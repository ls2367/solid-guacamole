        <h3>Completed stories</h3>
        <p>#20 populate project backlog: As a team, we are aware of all the steps that need to be completed in order to finish the project on time. Most stories for the 3 sprints have been laid out
        </p>
        <p>#21 groom project backlog: As a team, we are aware of the different features that have to be added to the website, entailed by each user story. Furthermore, we are aware of particular one-sided dependencies between the user stories.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Narrative past</h3>
        <p>In this week's sprint we managed to populate the product backlog with a total of 
        9 user stories. We created 3 final project stories which are greater "Kyle" stories. Furthermore, we created
        stories for the timely creation of three sprint reports. We already started experimenting with the CSS and HTML file to try to understand 
        how they are linked together.</p>
        
        <h3>Project backlog</h3>
        <p>In our project backlog you will find 14 new issues to which we assigned a total of 26 points. Beware that so far we only awarded 2 issues the total amount of points. In our
        upcoming sprint planning meeting we will assign points to the remaining issues</p>
